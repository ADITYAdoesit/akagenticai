# Same comparison as traditional_vs_agentic_rag.py, but the live-web leg
# is backed by SerpAPI (Google search results) instead of Tavily. Both
# approaches still answer against the SAME FAQ knowledge base
# (support_ticketing_agent_hitl.py's ChromaDB index), so the comparison
# isolates the RETRIEVAL STRATEGY, not the data.
#
# Traditional RAG: retrieve once -> stuff into context -> generate.
# A fixed pipeline, no matter what the question actually needs.
#
# Agentic RAG: an Agents SDK agent with TWO tools - search the FAQ
# knowledge base, or search the live web - where the agent's own
# reasoning decides which to call, whether one search is enough, and
# how many rounds to run before answering. The diagram's "Enough
# information?" loop IS the agent's own tool-calling loop; there's no
# separate check written in this file for it.

Answer the user's question as a customer support assistant.
1. Start with search_knowledge_base - most routine questions are answered there.
2. If the knowledge base doesn't have relevant information, or the question needs
   something the KB can't know (current status, recent news, live conditions),
   call search_web instead.
3. You may call either tool more than once, or both, if one search isn't enough.
4. Once you have enough information, answer directly and briefly. If neither source
   has the answer, say so honestly.
