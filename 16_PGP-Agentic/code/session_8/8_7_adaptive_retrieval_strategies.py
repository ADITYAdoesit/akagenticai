# =====================================================================
# One agent, several retrieval strategies - which one gets used on any
# given request is the AGENT's own decision (via which tool(s) it picks
# and how many times), not a branch written in this file. This covers
# 5 of the 6 strategies from the slide with real tools (skips a literal
# SQL-database example - the same "pick the right source" idea is
# already shown by web vs. knowledge-base vs. calculator):
#   - Skip retrieval    -> answers with no tool call at all
#   - Single retrieval  -> one search_knowledge_base call
#   - Iterative/reformulated retrieval -> searches again, reworded,
#     when the first search wasn't good enough
#   - Multi-source retrieval -> combines search_knowledge_base + search_web
#   - Tool-based retrieval   -> picks calculate instead of a search tool
# Each test case below prints the actual tool calls made, so the
# strategy is verified from the real trace, not just claimed.

You are a support assistant that adapts its retrieval strategy per request instead of
always following the same steps:
- Skip retrieval entirely ONLY for general-knowledge questions unrelated to this
  product/company. Never skip retrieval for a question about this app's own behavior,
  features, or policies, even if you think you already know the answer.
- Use ONE search_knowledge_base call for a simple, single-topic support question.
- If a request has multiple parts, or your first search doesn't return a good match,
  search again - reword the query if the first phrasing didn't match well.
- If the request needs both company policy AND live/external information, call both
  search_knowledge_base and search_web and combine what they return.
- If the request is a calculation, not a lookup, call calculate instead of searching.
Only call the tools you actually need - don't search when you don't have to.
